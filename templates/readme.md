**Instructions for Use:**

1. **Customization via ChatGPT:**
   - Copy the `profile.yaml` template.
   - Prepare your personal details (age, weight, goals, equipment, etc.).
   - Ask ChatGPT:  
     *"Here is my profile template (paste YAML). My details are: [your details]. Please produce a completed profile.yaml for me."*  
   - ChatGPT will fill in the placeholders to create your personal `profile.yaml`.

2. **Local Storage:**
   - Save the completed `profile.yaml` in your local `data/` directory.
   - Ensure that `data/` is listed in your `.gitignore` file, preventing any personal data from being committed to version control.

3. **Updating and Evolving:**
   - If your details change over time (e.g., new goals, equipment, or injury status), repeat the process:
     - Provide your current `profile.yaml` and highlight the changes.
     - Ask ChatGPT to update and produce a new, revised `profile.yaml`.
   - Replace the old file in `data/` with the updated version.

4. **Privacy Considerations:**
   - Keep your `profile.yaml` file private, as it may contain sensitive information.
   - Avoid including personally identifiable information if you plan to share your repository publicly.
   - Use generic or anonymized descriptors where possible.
