# Workout Card: YYYY-MM-DD

**Overview:**  
Summarize the purpose of the session (e.g., "Today’s workout builds posterior chain strength and explosive power to support ultramarathon goals."). Connect to specific goals or upcoming events.

**Context:**
- **Linked Events:** Explain how this session prepares for specific events (e.g., a long run).  
- **Linked Goals:** Highlight how the workout supports broader objectives (e.g., "Progress toward shouldering a 225 lb sandbag").

**Warm-Up:**
- **Dynamic Warm-Up (5–10 minutes):** Include general movements (e.g., Airdyne, rowing, or light calisthenics).  
  - Purpose: Loosen joints, elevate heart rate, and prep muscles for activity.  
  - Tags: [warmup, activation, mobility]

**Exercises (Circuit or Individual):**
1. **Exercise Name:**
   - Sets: X  
   - Reps: X  
   - Load: X lbs  
   - Notes: Include technique tips or specific focus areas (e.g., "Maintain neutral spine").  
   - Tags: [strength, core, power]
2. **Exercise Name:**
   - Sets: X  
   - Duration/Distance: X  
   - Notes: Add adjustments for load or form (e.g., "Use lighter sandbag for endurance focus").

**Finisher (Optional):**
- Include conditioning drills, such as a HIIT Tabata or sprints.  
  - Purpose: Add metabolic conditioning to the end of the session.  
  - Tags: [HIIT, conditioning, explosive]

**Rest:**  
- Rest times between sets/rounds (e.g., "2–3 minutes"). Adjust based on effort or fatigue.

**Cool Down:**
- **Yoga Sequence or Static Stretching:** Focus on recovery with poses or stretches targeting key areas (e.g., hips, back, shoulders).  
  - Purpose: Release tension, promote flexibility, and enhance recovery.  
  - Tags: [cooldown, recovery, mobility]

**Summary / Day Notes:**
- **Effort Level:** Reflect on intensity and any challenges (e.g., "Grip failure during Farmer’s Walk").  
- **Deviations:** Note any adjustments or modifications.  
- **Reflections:** Include feedback on performance and areas to focus on next time (e.g., "Work on stability during sandbag lifts").
