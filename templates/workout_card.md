# Workout Card: 2024-01-15

**Overview:**  
Today’s session focuses on functional lower-body strength using sandbag and trap bar movements, plus a short conditioning finisher to support endurance and mild fat loss goals. Posture and mobility drills included to address thoracic spine issues.

**Exercises:**

1. **Sandbag Shouldering**  
   - Sets: 3  
   - Reps: [5,5,5]  
   - Load: 100 lb sandbag  
   - Notes: Emphasize explosive hip drive, monitor elbow discomfort.  
   - Tags: [sandbag, power, legs, core]

2. **Farmer Walks**  
   - Sets: 4 (trips ~20 yards each)  
   - Load: 2x50lb kegs  
   - Notes: Maintain upright posture, stable core engagement.  
   - Tags: [farmer_carry, grip_strength, core, posture]

3. **Trap Bar RDL**  
   - Sets: 3  
   - Reps: [8,8,8]  
   - Load: ~185lbs  
   - Notes: Focus on hamstrings and flat back, mindful of knee alignment.  
   - Tags: [trap_bar, posterior_chain, strength, legs]

4. **Kettlebell Swings**  
   - Sets: 3  
   - Reps: [15,15,15]  
   - KB: 25lb  
   - Notes: Explosive hip drive for conditioning effect, keep shoulders stable.  
   - Tags: [kettlebell, conditioning, hips]

**Conditioning Finisher (Optional):**  
- Tabata Airdyne: 4 minutes (20s on / 10s off)  
- Purpose: Increase aerobic capacity, support mild fat loss.  
- Tags: [tabata, airdyne, conditioning]

**Injury & Mobility Considerations:**  
- Left elbow: Use neutral grips where possible; avoid pain.  
- Shoulder: Thorough warm-up completed. Monitor overhead pressure.  
- Posture/Mobility: 5 minutes T-spine mobilization post-workout (cat-cow stretches, foam rolling).  
- Tags: [mobility, injury_prevention, posture_work]

**Summary / Future Reference:**  
- Good functional strength session with added conditioning.  
- Consider slightly heavier swings next time if elbow feels stable.  
- Maintain regular T-spine mobility to improve posture over time.  
- Tags: [progression, long_term]

**Instructions for Use:**

- **Daily Logging:**  
  Each day, ChatGPT can output a workout card in this format. You copy the card into your Obsidian vault’s `workouts/` folder and name it something like `2024-01-15_workout.md`.

- **Linking and Graph Analysis:**  
  The YAML front matter and consistent tags make it easy to later parse these notes for a graph database or semantic analysis.  
  - Tools can read `tags`, `equipment_used`, or `muscle_focus` from the YAML to form nodes and edges in a graph DB.  
  - Obsidian’s built-in graph view will show connections between workouts, muscle groups, and goals.

- **Historical Trends:**  
  Over time, you’ll accumulate these structured notes. You can write scripts to:
  - Extract data from the front matter fields.
  - Summarize how often you used a certain piece of equipment.
  - Track the frequency of “deviations.”
  - Map out periods of high conditioning vs. high strength focus.

**Adjusting for Simplicity:**  
If the template feels too verbose, you can drop certain fields. The key is to have a consistent structure:  
- YAML front matter for metadata and tags.
- A clear section for exercises, sets, reps, and weights.
- Notes and tags for future searches.

This template provides a stable foundation to build upon as your needs evolve.
